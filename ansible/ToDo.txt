Overview:

Container       Has Net     Has User    Has Volumes

Cockpit         -           -           -
ddclient        x           x           x
nextcloud-db    x           -           x
nextcloud-fpm   x           x           x

proxy-nginx     x           -           x
samba           -           -           x

web-nginx       x           x           x

1. Implement users for proxy and db containers
2. Implement resource limits for containers, mostly plex and samba
3. Implement own network for cockpit and tor
4. Fix proxy-nginx, it does not wait for nextcloud-web, keeps failing
5. Fix proxy-certbot, blocks nextcloud-web or fpm because of ip conflicts?

x. Make firewalld, docker and fail2ban work together properly
