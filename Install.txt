# Install packages/enable services:
rpm-ostree install git ansible fail2ban google-authenticator

# firewalld doesn't work properly with docker and fail2ban atm.
systemctl disable firewalld

# Only enable, config and start happens via ansible
systemctl enable fail2ban

# Nextcloud installation must be finished manually.
# Trusted domains must be added manually if more than one domain
# or local access via server_name is requierd.

# Securing the Server:
# We want root lock down the root user for required uses only, so
# ssh login from external ip addresses should be forbidden.
# Instead a new admin user should be added, which has root access
# to cockpit. The new admin must be secured two factor authentication
# when logging into the system.
# 2fa can be achieved with pam module from google. It is possible to
# enable 2fa for certain users only, but it has to be initialized for
# each user manually.

# This can be ported to fedora atomic.
#
# Additionally, ssh login for root must be restricted to allow local
# connections only. This can be achieved by changing sshd_conf:
# ...
# PermitRootLogin no
# ...
# Match Address 127.0.0.1,192.168.178.0/24,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8
#   PermitRootLogin yes
